# Operational_Research_Activities
In this repository there's all the activities' tasks given by Foundation of Operational Research course at Politecnico di Milano, Computer Science and Engineering master's degree


## First Task:
- ### 10766393    Alberto Cantele ([@CntAlberto](https://github.com/CntAlberto))<br>alberto.cantele@mail.polimi.it
- ### 10767701    Biagio Cancelliere ([@Biasinobibi](https://github.com/Biasinobibi))<br>biagio.cancelliere@mail.polimi.it
Inside First_Task folder there's the solution of a given problem: "A dangerous Hiking" wich purpose is maximise an Hiking equipment starting from wight and Survival Points. <br>
Given this table in wich any object has different weights and different Survival Points, create an algorithm that find the best configuration of objects where the total weight is less than 25 Kg and survivial points are maximised <br>
The solution is written under the assumption that we can fix defense object as the weightest becuse is the object that most maximise Survival Points with at the most minimum weight <br>
