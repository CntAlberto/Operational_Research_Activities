## First Task:
Inside First_Task folder there's the solution of the given problem: "A dangerous Hiking" wich purpose is maximise an Hiking equipment starting from wight and Survival Points. <br>
Given this table in wich any object has different weights and different Survival Points, create an algorithm that find the best configuration of objects where the total weight is less than 25 Kg and survivial points are maximised. <br>
The solution is written under the assumption that we can fix defense object as the weightest becuse is the object that most maximise Survival Points with at the most minimum weight. <br>

## Second Task:
Inside Secon_Task folder there's the solution of the request: "Express statement with linear constraints" <rb>
Proposed solution introduce the concept of logical variables which are useful in order to define which constraints to satisfy or which variable is useful to the solution of the problems <br>
Given values: <br>
