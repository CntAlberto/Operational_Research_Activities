## First Task:
Inside First Task folder there's the solution of the given problem: "A dangerous Hiking" which purpose is maximise an Hiking equipment starting from wight and Survival Points. <br>
Given this table in wich any object has different weights and different Survival Points, create an algorithm that find the best configuration of objects where the total weight is less than 25 Kg and survivial points are maximised. <br>
The solution is written under the assumption that we can fix defense object as the weightest becuse is the object that most maximise Survival Points with at the most minimum weight. <br>
 Table: <br>

<br>
## Second Task:
Inside Second Task folder there's the solution of the request: "Diet". <rb>
Proposed solution introduce the concept of logical variables which are useful in order to define which constraints to satisfy or which variable is useful to the solution of the problems. <br>
Given values: <br>

<br>
## Third Task
Inside Third Task folder there's the solution of the given problem: "Job Scheduling" which purpose is minimize the job of a machine that has to process N jobs.<rb>
Given the processing time for a certain job "j" and given the set up time s(i,j) for changing the machine set up from job "i" o job "j" Decide the sequence of jobs that minimizes the overall processing time. <br>

<br>
## Fourth Task
Inside Fourth Task folder there's the solution of the give problem: "Puzzle". <rb>
Two friends are lost in desert with 8 liters of water and 3 bottles with different capacities, knowing that water can be pured from a bottle to another if and only if a bottle is completely emptied or a bottle is completely filled. <br>
Find a model (and possibly a solution) to the minimum sequence of operation providing the required result in the image (inside the image there are also all the given information and constraints). <br>

<br>
## Fifth Task
Inside Fifth Task folder there's the solution of the request: "Matching Game". <rb>
Given this table, from as many couple female and male as possible so that in a couple there is at least one trait in common. <br>
